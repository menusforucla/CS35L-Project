## Quick Start

To get it running, follow the steps below:

### 1. Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/): We used [Planetscale](https://planetscale.com) for this project.
- [uploadthing](https://uploadthing.com/) image uploading service
- [OAuth 2.0 credentials](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials)

### 2. Setup dependencies

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm i

# Configure environment variables
# There is an `.env.example` in the root directory that you can use as a template.
cp .env.example .env

# Push the Drizzle schema to the database
pnpm db:push
```

### 3. Running the app/website

#### Use Browser

1. Run `pnpm --filter nextjs dev` at the project root folder. This should run the website on http://localhost:3000.


## Deployment

### Next.js

#### Prerequisites

> **Note**
> Please note that the Next.js application with tRPC must be deployed in order for the Expo app to communicate with the server in a production environment.

#### Deploy to Vercel

Let's deploy the Next.js application to [Vercel](https://vercel.com). If you've never deployed a Turborepo app there, don't worry, the steps are quite straightforward. You can also read the [official Turborepo guide](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/monorepos/turborepo) on deploying to Vercel.

1. Create a new project on Vercel, select the `apps/nextjs` folder as the root directory. Vercel's zero-config system should handle all configurations for you.

2. Add your `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

3. Done! Your app should successfully deploy. Assign your domain and use that instead of `localhost` for the `url` in the Expo app so that your Expo app can communicate with your backend when you are not in development.

### Auth Proxy

The auth proxy is a Nitro server that proxies OAuth requests in preview deployments. This is required for the Next.js app to be able to authenticate users in preview deployments. The auth proxy is not used for OAuth requests in production deployments. To get it running, it's easiest to use Vercel Edge functions. See the [Nitro docs](https://nitro.unjs.io/deploy/providers/vercel#vercel-edge-functions) for how to deploy Nitro to Vercel.

Then, there are some environment variables you need to set in order to get OAuth working:

- For the Next.js app, set `AUTH_REDIRECT_PROXY_URL` to the URL of the auth proxy.
- For the auth proxy server, set `AUTH_REDIRECT_PROXY_URL` to the same as above, as well as `AUTH_DISCORD_ID`, `AUTH_DISCORD_SECRET` (or the equivalent for your OAuth provider(s)). Lastly, set `AUTH_SECRET` **to the same value as in the Next.js app** for preview environments.

Read more about the setup in [the auth proxy README](./apps/auth-proxy/README.md).
